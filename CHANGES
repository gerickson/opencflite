2021-07-28 v635.21.2

  * Pulled a change from the 476 branch which addresses an issue in
    which ICU no longer uses icu-config or pkg-config that results in
    pkg-config for CoreFoundation failing.

2021-07-27 v635.21.1

  * Applied upstream Apple patches from CF-635.19 to CF-635.21.

2021-07-27 v635.19.1

  * Applied upstream Apple patches from CF-635.15 to CF-635.19.

2021-07-27 v635.15.1

  * Addressed a warning/error about the unknown type name of
    'CFStreamError' when compiling against the project on Linux.

  * Address a warning/error about the redefinition of 'struct
    timespec' when compiling against the project on Linux.

  * Addressed an issue in which an allowably-NULL 'cancel'
    CFRunLoopSourceContext callout pointer causes a crash in
    CFRunLoopSourceRemove.

  * Integrated improvements from the 476 branch, including: CFNetwork
    support; autotools improvements, including silent-rules,
    subdir-objects, and -DDEFAULT_SOURCE; GitHub Actions continuous
    integration, and CFFileDescriptor.

  * Added support for x86_64 targets.

2021-07-24 v476.19.5

  * Addressed an issue in which the 'closeOnInvalidate'
    flag was not honored through the CFFileDescriptorCreate
    to CFFileDescriptorInvalidate lifecycle.

2021-07-19 v476.19.4

  * Addressed an issue in which back-to-back CFFileDescriptor
    objects created in sequence result in the second and
    subsequent such descriptor objects fulfilled from the
    stale manager cache with an invalid native descriptor
    value.

2021-07-14 v476.19.3

  * Enabled dynamic CFNetwork support on Linux.

2021-07-07 v476.19.2

  * Addressed an issue with an uninitialized read of the
    timeout value passed to select in __CFFileDescriptorManager.

2021-07-02 v476.19.1

  * Added CFFileDescriptor support.

2021-06-10 v476.19.0

  * Forked and migrated the package to GitHub.

  * Enabled continuous integration (CI) with GitHub actions against
    Linux with both GCC and clang/LLVM.

  * Migrated the README content to Markdown and added a GitHub CI
    build badge.

  * Modernized configure.ac, including by utilizing 'subdir-objects'
    and by making the build less chatty by default by leveraging
    'silent-rules'.

2011-09-07 v476.19.0

  * Address a bug in CFSetApplyFunction that can result in it
    accessing and modifying deallocated key memory when iterating over
    a mutable set while simultaneously mutating it where those
    mutations might lead to the growth or shrinkage of the set.

  * Remove support, on Linux, for using the malloc_usable_size
    introspection method when instantiating CoreFoundation runtime
    instances.

  * Add support for performing debug consistency checks in Linux on
    memory deallocated by the system allocator.

  * Upgrade the AssertMacros.h from CarbonHeaders-8A428 to that from
    CarbonHeaders-18.1 to address rdar://problem/4822326 where
    executing verify*action with break or continue ends up failing to
    actually work as expected or intended.

  * Added ARM support.

  * Only define __kCFCharacterSetDir if it is not already defined.

  * Address a number of compiler warnings and errors.

  * Fixed run loop symbol visibility under Linux.

  * Use strtoul rathern than strtoul_l when passing NULL as the
    extended locale.

  * Limited symbol and function visiblity based on appropriate
    preprocessor definitions.

  * Merged change to ensure that the right LDFLAGS are passed when
    testing for the existing of uuid_compare in libuuid with using
    --with-uuid and friends from trunk.

  * Reconfigured following update to configure.ac for pushing/popping
    UUID_LDFLAGS when testing uuid_compare in -luuid.

2009-06-02 v476.18.0

  * Synchronized against Apple's CoreFoundation-478.18.

  * Added CFFileDescriptor and CFNotificationCenter support from Stuart Crook
    <stuart@echus.demon.co.uk>.

2009-03-11 v476.17.2

  * Fixed run loop timer support for Linux.

  * Updated pre-compiled ICU to v4.0 for Windows builds.

  * Minor updates to CFRunLoopTimerExample and StringExample examples.

  * Merged in David Cotter's <me@davecotter.com> CF-Lite project,
    including his additional CFTest example.

  * Fixed support for writing binary property lists with patch from Stuart
    Crook <stuart@echus.demon.co.uk>.

2007-02-11 v476.17.1

  * Basic, development-level run loop support for Windows and Linux.

  * Ensure private globals are marked as such on non-Apple GCC
    compilers.

  * Added DisplayURL, DNSServiceMetaQuery, CFLocalServer and
    CFRunLoopTimer examples.

  * Added appropriate preprocessor checks for __powerpc__ to handle
    PowerPC compilers that emit that rather than __ppc__.

  * Windows and Mac OS X build clean-ups.

  * Improved Linux build configuration by respecting '--with' options
    in preference to the presence of <foo>-config and, in general,
    improved behavior in cross-compilation scenarios and in error
    cases.
