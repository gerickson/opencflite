                      Changes and What's New in OpenCFLite
                      ------------------------------------

2021-11-02 v635.21.6

  * Addressed resource leaks on Linux and FreeBSD identified by the
    address sanitizer with the use of CFFileDescriptor when a process
    terminates.

  * Addressed resource leaks on Linux and FreeBSD identified by the
    address sanitizer with the use of CFRunLoop when a process
    terminates.

  * Completely revamped the run loop wake up and timer implementation
    for Linux and FreeBSD based on kqueue/libkqueue using EVFILT_USER
    (wake up) and EVFILT_TIMER (timer), respectively. In the process,
    addressed issues in which run loops spun open loop, rather than
    waiting; in which timers would never fire; and in which Control-C
    (SIGINT) would not terminate a process that had invoked
    CFRunLoopRun.

  * Enhanced the output of CFRunLoopTimer example to include the timer
    firing delta and the variance from the expected interval. In
    addition, better handle failures such that the example does not
    appear to be successful when, in fact, it was not.

  * Addressed an issue in which the spin lock implementation on Linux
    was not providing any mutual exclusion.

  * Addressed an issue in which __CFActiveProcessorCount did not
    return an accurate value for Linux.

  * Addressed an issue in which a number of example applications were
    using old, deprecated APIs that no longer would work or compile on
    modern versions of iOS/macOS/tvOS.

  * Addressed resources leaks in the example applications.

  * Addressed an issue in which __CFInitialize would fault when built
    with the address anitizer.

  * Addressed an issue in which CFShow would fault when built with the
    address anitizer.

2021-09-15 v635.21.5

  * Addressed an issue in which attempting to write a Property List
    with the format 'kCFPropertyListBinaryFormat_v1_0' via
    'CFPropertyListWrite' failed silently on Linux (and ostensibly
    FreeBSD as well).

2021-07-29 v635.21.4

  * Addressed an issue in which continuous integration failed against
    the 'BundleExample' example program by ensuring that the example
    works when the package is not installed or is not installed in a
    default location.

2021-07-28 v635.21.3

  * Addressed an issue in which 'CFPropertyList{CreateWithStream,
    Write}' were not available when building against the pacakge on
    Linux since these symbols are guarded by TARGET_OS_LINUX rather
    than TARGET_OS_UNIX.

  * Addressed an implicit conversion warning/error for _CFHashDouble
    in ForFoundation.h.

2021-07-28 v635.21.2

  * Pulled a change from the 476 branch which addresses an issue in
    which ICU no longer uses icu-config or pkg-config that results in
    pkg-config for CoreFoundation failing.

2021-07-27 v635.21.1

  * Applied upstream Apple patches from CF-635.19 to CF-635.21.

2021-07-27 v635.19.1

  * Applied upstream Apple patches from CF-635.15 to CF-635.19.

2021-07-27 v635.15.1

  * Addressed a warning/error about the unknown type name of
    'CFStreamError' when compiling against the project on Linux.

  * Address a warning/error about the redefinition of 'struct
    timespec' when compiling against the project on Linux.

  * Addressed an issue in which an allowably-NULL 'cancel'
    CFRunLoopSourceContext callout pointer causes a crash in
    CFRunLoopSourceRemove.

  * Integrated improvements from the 476 branch, including: CFNetwork
    support; autotools improvements, including silent-rules,
    subdir-objects, and -DDEFAULT_SOURCE; GitHub Actions continuous
    integration, and CFFileDescriptor.

  * Added support for x86_64 targets.

2021-07-24 v476.19.5

  * Addressed an issue in which the 'closeOnInvalidate'
    flag was not honored through the CFFileDescriptorCreate
    to CFFileDescriptorInvalidate lifecycle.

2021-07-19 v476.19.4

  * Addressed an issue in which back-to-back CFFileDescriptor
    objects created in sequence result in the second and
    subsequent such descriptor objects fulfilled from the
    stale manager cache with an invalid native descriptor
    value.

2021-07-14 v476.19.3

  * Enabled dynamic CFNetwork support on Linux.

2021-07-07 v476.19.2

  * Addressed an issue with an uninitialized read of the
    timeout value passed to select in __CFFileDescriptorManager.

2021-07-02 v476.19.1

  * Added CFFileDescriptor support.

2021-06-10 v476.19.0

  * Forked and migrated the package to GitHub.

  * Enabled continuous integration (CI) with GitHub actions against
    Linux with both GCC and clang/LLVM.

  * Migrated the README content to Markdown and added a GitHub CI
    build badge.

  * Modernized configure.ac, including by utilizing 'subdir-objects'
    and by making the build less chatty by default by leveraging
    'silent-rules'.

2011-09-07 v476.19.0

  * Address a bug in CFSetApplyFunction that can result in it
    accessing and modifying deallocated key memory when iterating over
    a mutable set while simultaneously mutating it where those
    mutations might lead to the growth or shrinkage of the set.

  * Remove support, on Linux, for using the malloc_usable_size
    introspection method when instantiating CoreFoundation runtime
    instances.

  * Add support for performing debug consistency checks in Linux on
    memory deallocated by the system allocator.

  * Upgrade the AssertMacros.h from CarbonHeaders-8A428 to that from
    CarbonHeaders-18.1 to address rdar://problem/4822326 where
    executing verify*action with break or continue ends up failing to
    actually work as expected or intended.

  * Added ARM support.

  * Only define __kCFCharacterSetDir if it is not already defined.

  * Address a number of compiler warnings and errors.

  * Fixed run loop symbol visibility under Linux.

  * Use strtoul rathern than strtoul_l when passing NULL as the
    extended locale.

  * Limited symbol and function visiblity based on appropriate
    preprocessor definitions.

  * Merged change to ensure that the right LDFLAGS are passed when
    testing for the existing of uuid_compare in libuuid with using
    --with-uuid and friends from trunk.

  * Reconfigured following update to configure.ac for pushing/popping
    UUID_LDFLAGS when testing uuid_compare in -luuid.

2009-06-02 v476.18.0

  * Synchronized against Apple's CoreFoundation-478.18.

  * Added CFFileDescriptor and CFNotificationCenter support from Stuart Crook
    <stuart@echus.demon.co.uk>.

2009-03-11 v476.17.2

  * Fixed run loop timer support for Linux.

  * Updated pre-compiled ICU to v4.0 for Windows builds.

  * Minor updates to CFRunLoopTimerExample and StringExample examples.

  * Merged in David Cotter's <me@davecotter.com> CF-Lite project,
    including his additional CFTest example.

  * Fixed support for writing binary property lists with patch from Stuart
    Crook <stuart@echus.demon.co.uk>.

2007-02-11 v476.17.1

  * Basic, development-level run loop support for Windows and Linux.

  * Ensure private globals are marked as such on non-Apple GCC
    compilers.

  * Added DisplayURL, DNSServiceMetaQuery, CFLocalServer and
    CFRunLoopTimer examples.

  * Added appropriate preprocessor checks for __powerpc__ to handle
    PowerPC compilers that emit that rather than __ppc__.

  * Windows and Mac OS X build clean-ups.

  * Improved Linux build configuration by respecting '--with' options
    in preference to the presence of <foo>-config and, in general,
    improved behavior in cross-compilation scenarios and in error
    cases.

2007-02-06 v476.17.0

  * Initial release for Windows and Linux
