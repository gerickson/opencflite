                      Changes and What's New in OpenCFLite
                      ------------------------------------

2007-02-11 v476.17.1

  * Basic, development-level run loop support for Windows and Linux.

  * Ensure private globals are marked as such on non-Apple GCC
    compilers.

  * Added DisplayURL, DNSServiceMetaQuery, CFLocalServer and
    CFRunLoopTimer examples.

  * Added appropriate preprocessor checks for __powerpc__ to handle
    PowerPC compilers that emit that rather than __ppc__.

  * Windows and Mac OS X build clean-ups.

  * Improved Linux build configuration by respecting '--with' options
    in preference to the presence of <foo>-config and, in general,
    improved behavior in cross-compilation scenarios and in error
    cases.

2007-02-06 v476.17.0

  * Initial release for Windows and Linux
