Mac OS X and Linux ship with ICU.  Since WIndows does not, the distribution
includes the necessary ICU 3.6 link libraries and DLLs to build CFLite.dll.

Note the these are the same DLLs that ship with Safari, and want to link
against MSVCR80.dll.  You will get an error on startup if you do not
have this dll in your path.

If you are targeting minw32, you might be better of just building ICU on
that system (or use the binary ICU distribution).
