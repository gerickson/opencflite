    <EditText>Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes 
there is no hope for tomorrow

How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, 
so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, 
I'm the one you must rely on

You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches 
come and they go 
and the scars they're leaving

You'll be dancing once again 
and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving

Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky 
and shining above you

Let me hear you sing once more 
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Try once more like 
you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems 
too hard to handle

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches 
come and they go 
and the scars they're leaving

You'll be dancing once again 
and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving

Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky 
and shining above you

Let me hear you sing once more 
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Try once more 
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Try once more 
like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita</EditText>
