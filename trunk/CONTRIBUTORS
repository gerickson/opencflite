March 2000: partial port to Linux by Pedro Ivo Tavares (ptavares@iname.com).
	This was mostly integrated by ckane@apple.com by CoreFoundation-5,
	but the style was changed, and the hand-crafted Makefile, which is
	new since this port, tries to take care of some of the things that
	are needed for Linux (and build a libCoreFoundation.a instead of a
	CoreFoundation.framework), but ckane does not have a Linux box and
	can't finish that and test building.

December 2000: port to FreeBSD by Sarwat Khan (sarwat@sarwat.net).
	Port to FreeBSD, except for RunLoop.subproj items.  Integrated by
	ckane@apple.com into CoreFoundation-8.  ckane also marginally
	improved the Linux port in that version.

March 2001: CoreFoundation-9, corresponding to CoreFoundation-197 in

May 2001: CoreFoundation-10, corresponding to CoreFoundation-206.5
	synchronizes Darwin CF with TOT CoreFoundation.
