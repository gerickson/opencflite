objc4 test suite README

To run the tests:
  `make` in this directory, or `make test` in the top-level directory

Correct test output consists of 'PASS: testname' for each test. 
No other output should be seen.

Other options: 
  `make` tests the installed libobjc
  `make buildit` tests the libobjc in /tmp/objc4-roots/objc4~sym/
  `make local` tests the libobjc in ..

  `make GC=YES` runs with garbage collection on
  `make ARCHS=cpu` tests with the specified architecture (only one allowed)
  `make VALGRIND=YES` runs with valgrind on (memcheck and leak detection)
  `make GUARDMALLOC=YES` runs with GuardMalloc on

  `make OBJC_LIB=/path/to/libobjc.A.dylib` tests a specific objc4 build
  `make OTHER_CFLAGS=x` tests with specified flags

  `make VERBOSE=` logs progress of some tests
